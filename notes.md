# Docker and Kubernetes: The complete guide

## Section 1: Introduction

### The Docker ecosystem

Docker is an ecosystem for creating and running **containers**

The Docker ecosystem consists of:

- Docker **Client** (CLI)
- Docker **Server** (Daemon)
- Docker **Machine**
- Docker **Images**
- Docker **Hub**
- Docker **Compose**

An **Image** is a single file with all dependencies & configuration that is required to run a program.

A **Container** is an instance of an image. A container runs a program.

The docker **Client** (or CLI) allowed to interact with the **Docker Server** (or Daemon) using commands in order to
create images and run containers.

The `run` command starts a new container based on an image.

```bash
$ docker run hello-world
```

if a local copy of the image doesn't exist in the local cache of images, a new copy will be pull from the server and
will be instantiated.

### What is a container?

Before talking about containers we should take a brief overview of an OS structure:

![OS](./diagrams/01/kernel.png)


#### Namespacing and Control groups

**Namespacing** is the process of isolating resources per process (or group of processes). 

For example:

- Processes
- Hard drive
- Network
- Users
- Hostnames
- Inter Process Communication

**Control groups** can be used to limit the amount of resources per process

For example:

- Memory
- CPU usage
- HD I/O
- Network Bandwidth

Namespacing and control groups are features specific to **Linux**, when installing docker on mac or windows, a **Linux**
VM is installed in the background.

![contToImage](./diagrams/01/stack.png)

When referring to the **container** we are essentially referring to the running process (e.g. chrome, nodeJS) 
**as well as** the segment of resources that it can talk to.

An image holds a "File System Snapshot" and a startup command.

When we "turn" an image into a container, the kernel will isolate a section of the hard drive and make it available to 
just this container, and the FS snapshot is copied into that segment of the HD.

## Section 2 : Manipulating Containers with the Docker Client

A closer look into some of the docker commands and their output:

- `docker run <image_name> <startup_command>` - runs a container
    
    + `docker run` == `docker create` + `docker start`
    
    - **image_name** - the name of the image to run
    - **startup_command** - a command that is executed when the container starts up (overrides the default stratup command) 
    
    ```bash
    $ docker run busybox ls
    bin
    dev
    etc
    home
    proc
    root
    sys
    tmp
    usr
    var
    ```
    
    *note*: the busybox image has the `ls` and `echo` executables in its file system snapshot.
    
- `docker ps` - lists all running containers (adding `--all` will list also non running containers)
    
    ```bash
    $ docker ps --all
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
    e198d4f2d08c        busybox             "ls"                10 minutes ago      Exited (0) 10 minutes ago                       infallible_dewdney
    70948c878d0c        busybox             "echo bye there"    10 minutes ago      Exited (0) 10 minutes ago                       zen_dhawan
    ec854374d371        busybox             "echo hi there"     11 minutes ago      Exited (0) 11 minutes ago                       inspiring_curran
    d704d40927ae        hello-world         "/hello"            2 hours ago         Exited (0) 2 hours ago                          hopeful_poincare
    ```

    a common use of the `ps` command is to find the id of a specific container.

-  `docker create <container_name>` - create a container
    
    ```bash
    $ docker create hello-world
    38734cc4663f2704e528442a21ecfa342f113ef2de36dd934aaf28cd33dd78fd
    ```
    **note**: The id on the created container is printed out

    * When a container is created, the file system snapshot it set up.

- `docker start -a <container_id>`
    
    **notes**: 

    - the `-a` flag makes docker watch for output from within the container and print it out to the local terminal

    - When a container starts, it means actually running the startup command.
    
    - When a container is *Exited*, it can be started back up by calling `dcoker start <container_id>`.

- `docker system prune` - deletes stopped containers and build cache (with all the images downloaded from docker hub).

- `docker logs <container_id>` - getting all of the output from a container.

    **note** the docker logs does **not** rerun the container.

- `docker stop <container_id>` - stop a running container by issueing a `SIGTERM` command (clean shutdown with cleanup)

- `docker kill <container_id>` - stop a running command by issuing a `SIGKILL` command (shuts down immediately without cleanup)

In many cases we might want to start another process inside an already running container. 
For example `redis-cli` needs to interact with redis server in order to work.
To do so, we will make use of the `exec` command

 - `docker exec -it <container_id> <command>` - execute a command inside a running container.
    
    - The **-it** flag allows to provide input to the container.
    - `-i` attaches the terminal to the `STDIN` channel of the running process
    - `-t` makes sure that all the text is nicely formatted

    ```bash
    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
    70dcaacef58a        redis               "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   6 minutes ago       Up 6 minutes        6379/tcp            pensive_dijkstra
    $ docker exec -it 70dcaacef58a redis-cli
    127.0.0.1:6379> set myvalue 3
    OK
    127.0.0.1:6379> get myvalue
    "3"
    ```

    Often times we would want to gain terminal or shell access to the running container:

    - `docker exec -it <container_id> sh` - opens the shell of the container
    
    **note**: `sh` is a program which is a command processor or a shell.

***Linux Sidenote***:

Every process in a linux environment has 3 communication channels: `STDIN`, `STDOUT` & `STDERR` attached to it, which are used to communicate information either into or out of a process.

`STDIN` is used to communicate into the process. the stuff we type in the terminal is being directed into a running `STDIN` channel attached to a process

`STDOUT` conveys information coming out of the process.

`STDERR` conveys information coming out of the process that is "error in nature"

![stdin](./diagrams/02/stdin.png)


***Important note***: 2 containers **do not** automatically share the same file system. In order for 2 containers to share the same file system we need to specifically form up a connection between them.


## Section 3 - Building Custom Images Through Docker Server

Building a custom image is done by creating a `Dockerfile` and writing some configuration into it which will define how the container should behave.

The `Dockerfile` is sent to the docker server via the docker client which will then build a usable image.

### The general flow a Dockerfile

1. Specify a **base image**:    
2. Run some commands to install additional programs 
3. Specify a command to run on startup.

### The general structure of a Dockerfile

```
[INSTRUCTION] [ARGUMENTS]
[INSTRUCTION] [ARGUMENTS]
.
.
.
[INSTRUCTION] [ARGUMENTS]
``` 

### Practical Example: Create an image that runs redis-server:

Dockerfile: 

```docker
# Use an existing docker image as a base
FROM alpine

# Download and install a dependency
RUN apk add --update redis

# Tell the image what to do when it starts as a container
CMD ["redis-server"] 
```

and then:
```bash
$ docker build .
...
Successfully built ab5846e5b220

$ docker run ab5846e5b220
...
1:M 21 Dec 13:06:48.603 * Ready to accept connections
```

### Breaking down the Dockerfile commands

- `FROM`: specify the docker image we want to use as a base
- `RUN`: execute some command while preparing the custom image
- `CMD`: specify what should be executed when the image is used to startup a new container

### What is Alpine? What is `apk`?

Alpine is an image that includes a default set of programs that are useful for installing and running redis.

In this case the useful command we used to create redis was `apk` (a package manager program)

### The build process in detail

`docker build <build_context>`

The *build context* is the set of files and folders that belong to our project.

1. `FROM alpine` 
    
    - downloaded the alpine image from docker hub
    
    ```bash
    Step 1/3 : FROM alpine
    latest: Pulling from library/alpine
    cd784148e348: Pull complete
    Digest: sha256:e1d4a235da8e7700f5f31d9f7130954b8cf64403e05f8fbb460cef138d90b2b3
    Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
     ---> 3f53bb00af94
    ```

2. `RUN apk add --update redis`
    
    - looked at the previous command in the Dockerfile (`FROM apline`)
    
    - took the image that was create in the previous step and created a new temporary container from that image
    
    - executed the command `apk add --update redis` as a process inside the temporary container 
    
    - stopped the temp. container
    
    - took a file system snapshot of the temp. container and save it as a temporary image.
    
    ```bash
    Step 2/3 : RUN apk add --update redis
     ---> Running in c7fccebec517
    fetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz
    fetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/community/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz
    (1/1) Installing redis (4.0.11-r0)
    Executing redis-4.0.11-r0.pre-install
    Executing redis-4.0.11-r0.post-install
    Executing busybox-1.28.4-r2.trigger
    OK: 6 MiB in 14 packages
    Removing intermediate container c7fccebec517
     ---> 8e04e07cfa8f
    ```   

3. `CMD ["redis-server"]`
    
    - look at the image from the previous step
    
    - create a new temporary container out of it
    
    - tells the container that its primary command should be `redis server`
    
    - shuts down the intermediate container
    
    - takes a snapshot of the file system and its primary command, and saves it as an image  
    
    ```bash
    Step 3/3 : CMD ["redis-server"]
     ---> Running in 4f897d0f2bc3
    Removing intermediate container 4f897d0f2bc3
     ---> ab5846e5b220
    Successfully built ab5846e5b220
    ```

![process](./diagrams/03/process.png)

### Rebuilds with Cache

Whenever we run a series of commands in the Dockerfile that have already been run the past, docker will use the cached 
images to run these commands again (unless the cache is cleaned with `docker system prune`).

If a new command has been added to the docker file, or the order o previous commands have chamged, then docker will 
create a new container and image, and also save that image to the cache.

### Tagging an image

An easier way to refer to an image (instead of copying and pasting long ids), is to give custom names to the image.

`docker build -t <tag_name> <build_context>`

The convention for image tags is: 
`<docker_id>/<project_name>:<version>`

for example:
`docker build -t erant10/redis:latest .`

### Manual image generation with docker commit

- installing redis on the alpine image:
    
    ```bash
    $ redis-image docker run -it alpine sh
    / # apk add --update redis
    fetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz
    fetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/community/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz
    (1/1) Installing redis (4.0.11-r0)
    Executing redis-4.0.11-r0.pre-install
    Executing redis-4.0.11-r0.post-install
    Executing busybox-1.28.4-r2.trigger
    OK: 6 MiB in 14 packages
    ```

- specifying the default command on startup:

    ```bash
    $ redis-image docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
    9fde27d4a817        alpine              "sh"                About a minute ago   Up About a minute                       pensive_torvalds
    $ redis-image docker commit -c 'CMD ["redis-server"]' 9fde27d4a817
    sha256:75e8685b60934463d0af9c280e12fb4b4ba555beec29c57f38db54a2d067e509
    ```

- running the newly created container:

    ```bash
    $ redis-image docker run 75e8685b6093446
    .
    .
    .
    Ready to accept connections
    ```
